Hence, a dataset with labeled data will be used to train and validate the model.\n\nThe dataset that I will use for this project is the shared dataset that is provided in the course syllabus named **'Data-Collisions.csv'**."

Not all attributes/features are useful, so some of them may need to be dropped. Some level of feature engineering will be required to reform the data in order to improve the predictability of the model. "
